### Referral list and lookup filters

`GET /api/careconnect/referrals` supports the standard paging inputs plus assistant-friendly filtering fields:

- `search` tokenizes natural-language phrases and matches across patient/client name, referrer contact, law-firm name, provider name, and provider organization name
- `providerName` to narrow results to a specific receiving provider or provider organization
- `referrerName` to narrow results to a referrer contact, law firm, or referring organization
- Existing queue filters such as `status`, `createdFrom`, `createdTo`, `providerId`, `referrerUserId`, and page params

These read-only filters are used by the tenant portal and by CareConnect's dedicated assistant-tool API. Xenia now
calls the assistant-only endpoints under `/api/assistant-tools/*` instead of composing results from the end-user
referral and provider APIs itself.

### Assistant tool API

CareConnect owns its grounded assistant contract for referral and provider workflows. The assistant-only endpoints:

- Reuse the caller's normal bearer-token access and participant scoping
- Return tool-shaped JSON for referral lookup/history, referral search, provider search, referrer search, and queue summaries
- Keep product-specific lookup composition inside CareConnect instead of in Xenia
